# Simulated_Aneling

Code Description
This code implements a simulated annealing algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. The code uses a random approach to generate initial solutions and then iteratively improves them using the simulated annealing technique.

Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites for running this code other than having Python installed.

Installation
Download the code file (e.g., tsp_simulated_annealing.py).
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

Usage
To use the code, follow these steps:

1.Import the required libraries (such as random,math etc) at the beginning of your code:

2.Declare the parameters for the simulated annealing algorithm:

3.Implement the acceptability function, which determines whether to accept a new solution based on its fitness:

4.Implement the count_fitness function, which calculates the fitness score of a given path:

5.Implement the get_neighbor function, which generates a neighboring solution by swapping two random cities:

6.Implement the simulated function, which performs the simulated annealing algorithm:

7.Provide the necessary input data and call the simulated function with the initial solution:
